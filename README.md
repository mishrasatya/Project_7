# Project_7
"Global Mart" is a giant online super store having worldwide operations. The major product categories that it deals with are consumer, corporate &amp; home office. The store caters to 7 different market segments and in 3 major categories. As we have to forecast at this granular level, we need to subset the data into 21 (7*3) buckets before analysing the data. All of these 21 market buckets are not important from the store's point of view. We need to find out 2 most profitable (and consistent) segment from these 21 and forecast the sales and quantity for these segments.
